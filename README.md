# CleanAgent: Automatically Standardize Your Data with LLM-based Agents
### Introduction
**`CleanAgent`** is a tool that automates the data standardization process with LLM-based Agents. You only need to upload the table that needs to be standardized, and **`CleanAgent`** will get your hands free, standardize your data automatically and return the standardized table to you.
Our demo paper **CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents** will be published in the future.
